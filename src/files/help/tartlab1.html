        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Welcome to TartLab! Here are some pointers to help you start using the app.</p>
        <h3>User interface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Files:</strong> The file panel can be opened by clicking the icon in the upper left corner.
                It lets you navigate through the folders and shows you the files in each.</li>
            <li><strong>Help:</strong> The help panel (you already found it!) provides information and examples to help you learn.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> The settings panel can be opened by clicking on the gear icon.
                It allows you to change WiFi settings and check for updated versions of TartLab.</li>
            <li><strong>Console:</strong> The command console can be opened and closed by clicking the gray area at the bottom of the screen.
                This is a powerful tool that allows you to send commands directly to the device.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Editor</h3>
        <p>
            You can load, edit, and create new files in TartLab.  Clicking on a file in the files panel (or an entry in the help panel)
            opens it in an editor tab. The "New" button gives you a new empty editor tab.  Once changes have been made to a file,
            the "Save" button is enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            When editing Python files (ending in .py), the editor will do automatic syntax highlighting.  This means that it helps
            you understand the code better by changing the colors of different parts of code.  However, the editor will not tell you
            whether your code works.  You will need to test it to find out!
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Here are some common questions and their answers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How can I see the files while using TartLab on my phone?</strong><br>On smaller mobile devices, the icon bar
                is hidden, but can be seen by pressing the &#9776; button. We recommend using tablets, laptops, or desktop computers
                for the best user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If something goes wrong, here's what you can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I keep getting a "failed to fetch" error.</strong><br>Make sure you are still connected to the WiFi hotspot
                shown on the device. Also, if the device is connecting to a WiFi router, make sure the device is close enough to
                the router to get a strong signal from it.</li>
        </ul>
