# pydisplay add_ons
=================
The files in this folder extend the functionality of pydisplay. They are not required for the basic functionality of pydisplay, but they can be useful for some applications.  Some of these files are not written by the author of pydisplay, but are included here for convenience.  Many of the examples
in the examples folder use these files.

To add add_ons to your path, simply run the following before importing any module that uses them:

```python
import add_ons.add_path
```

You may instead copy any of the files or directories to a location in your path such as `/lib`.
