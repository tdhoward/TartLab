The logo was created with Inkscape.  The favicon starts out as 256x256, since that is what is recommended, but it seems a bit large to be serving up a 96kB favicon from an embedded device.  As a result, I chose to use only the 48px, 32px and 16px versions, which should be sufficient.  These have also been edited by hand in Aseprite for better clarity at the lower resolutions.  ImageMagick was used to create the ICO file.
